            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

For as doctours do wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te there be .xii. vertues in remembrynge the
<pb facs="tcp:11235:61"/> lyfe and paſſyon of our lorde.</p>
                  <p>¶ The fyrſte vertue is / that the ſynner ofte tymes is conuerted therby / from his euyll &amp; peruerſe lyuynge to good and holy lyuyng ſo that god graunt hym repentaunce of his ſynnes / true confeſſyon and penaunce afo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re his deth.</p>
                  <p>¶ The ſeconde vertue is / that the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce of the paſſyon of our lorde is a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dycyne agaynſt the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptacyon of the deuyll. For howe great ſoeuer the temptacyon be / yf the man remembre cordyally the paſſyon of oure lorde / tournynge his iyes deuoutly vpon the croſſe of god / he ſhal be delyuered from the temptacyon.</p>
                  <p>¶ The thyrde vertue is / that our lord wyl make a ſure and a ſtedfaſte peace betwene the ſynner and his father celeſtyall.</p>
                  <p>¶ The fourth vertue is / that all trybulacy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ons: aduerſytes / ſyckenes / dyſeaſes / diſplea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſures / and temptacyons / ſhall be eaſye and lyght for that man to bere / whiche doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membre the paſſyon of our lorde. For ſaynt Gregorye ſayth / there is no grefe / dyſeaſe / nor diſpleaſure / but we may lyghtly vayn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quyſſhe it / yf we do remembre deuoutly the paſſyon of our lorde.</p>
                  <p>¶ The fyfthe vertue is / that ſuche a perſon
<pb facs="tcp:11235:62" rendition="simple:additions"/> hath more knowlege of god what his wyll is to be done or not to be done / tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other. ¶ The ſyxte vertue is / that oure lorde gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth deuocyon to ſuche men and doth exalt theyr prayer.

                  <pb facs="tcp:11235:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p>¶ The nynth vertue is / that the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce &amp; medytacyon of oure lorde Iheſu chryſte / doth paſſe and ſurmount all other corporall operacyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s / and is acceptable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to god aboue all thynges / after that man hath done true penaunce for his ſyn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>es.

                  <p>¶ The tenth vertue is / that the hertye and feruent medytacyon of the paſſyon of oure lord is more profytable to man / than yf our lady and all the ſayntes in heuen dyd pray for hym: that is to vnderſtande accordynge and after the dygnyte of the paſſyon of god For in the prayer of ſayntes dothe not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyſte our helth: as in the paſſyon of our lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de Iheſu chryſte.</p>
                  <p>¶ The eleuenth vertue is / y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the man whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che hath loſt &amp; myſpent his yonge age / may recouer that whiche he hath loſt and conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med / yf deuoutly and hertely he occupy and exercyſe hym ſelfe with the paſſyon of god: So that in ſhorte ſpace he may obteyne as great rewarde of god / as another in longe
<pb facs="tcp:11235:63" rendition="simple:additions"/> tyme whiche doth not occupye hym ſelfe in the paſſyon of god.</p>
                  <p>¶ The twelfth vertue is / that god ſhall ayde and conforte ſuche a man in the houre of deth / &amp; ſhall not departe from hym vnto he come to a good ende / &amp; ſauely be brought to euerlaſtynge lyfe. To the whiche the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther / the ſone / and the holy ghoſt brynge vs all. Amen.</p>

               <p>¶ The .xv. the corne is gronne and broken ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there is no parte therof left hole. This doth ſygnyfye howe our lorde beynge bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The two heuye ſtones of the myll / were the Iewes and Romaynes / as the ſeruauntes and ſergeauntes of Pylate. ¶ The .xvi. the corne thus broken is cyfted &amp; cauſed to paſſe through the cyue / whiche is full of lytell holes. This doth ſygnyfye howe Iheſus after that he was ſcourged was crowned with a crown of thorne / the whiche dyd make many holles in his blyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed heed wherof dyd tenne downe his blyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed blode abundauntly.</p>

               <p>¶ The .xviii. the breade thus myxte &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de / it is couered with a cloth. This doth ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnyfye howe after the ſentence gyuen by Pylate / the Iewes dyd cloth our lorde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne with his owne clothes.</p>
               <p>¶ The .xix. the breade begynneth to aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de &amp; ryſe. This doth ſygnyfye howe ſwete Iheſus charged with the heuye croſſe / dyd aſcende vp to the mount of Caluerye.</p>
               <p>¶ The .xx. the ouen is prepared for to bake the breade. This doth ſygnyfye that the Ie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wes dyd prepare the croſſe / for to crucyfye our lorde vpon the ſame.</p>
               <p>¶ The .xxi. the fyre is put in to the ouen / wherwith it is made hotte. This dothe ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnyfye the brennynge &amp; feruent loue / wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>with the herte of our lorde was kyndled &amp; ſet on fyre for to ſaue mankynde.</p>
               <p>¶ The .xxii. the cooles &amp; aſſhes be drawen out of the ouen &amp; the ouen made clene. This doth ſygnyfye howe our lorde ones agayne was ſpoyled of his robes by the Iewes / &amp; was lefte all naked.</p>

               <p>¶ The .xxiii. the breade is put in to the ouen to be baked. This doth ſygnyfie that the Ie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wes dyd caſt our lorde vpon the croſſe and there dyd faſten and nayle hym with great nayles.</p>
               <p>¶ The .xxiiii. than the ouen is iuſt ſtopped that there go none ayre forthe of it. This dothe ſygnyfye that the ſonne was darke &amp; ſtopped from his lyghte at the deth of oure lorde Iheſu chryſte.</p>
               <p>¶ Fynally whan the breade is well baked it is drawen out of the ouen. This doth ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnyfye howe after that our lorde was wel dryed and baked with the hete of the ſonne / he was taken downe from the croſſe. And as a man doth ſhytte &amp; locke vp the breades ſo was the body of our lorde buryed / ſhytte faſt and kepte / and the thyrde daye dyd ryſe from deth. All this done / the breade is perfy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te / wherof our lorde Iheſu chryſte doth ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke ſayenge. I am the lyuynge breade deſcen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded from heuen: all thoſe that do eate of this breade ſhall lyue euerlaſtyngly. O what it is ſwete to here in the eres of ſynners. Our lorde doth moue &amp; exorte vs poore ſynners ſpoyled and voyde of all vertues / to recey<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue his blyſſed body for the meate and reſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyon of our ſoule. But O good lorde man
<pb facs="tcp:11235:68"/> maye ſay / what am I that wolde preſume to receyue the: for neyther heuen nor erth can not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehende the / and ſhall I receyue the. O good lorde / howe ſhall I be ſo bolde as to receyue the / whiche hath done no maner of good afore thy face / but ofte tymes haue greued and offended thy dyuynyte. The ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly aungelles tremble for fere in thy preſence and the iuſt men fere and doubt thy power: and yet exhorteth and moueth me to recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue the.

Yf thou haddeſt not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded this / who wolde haue ben ſo bolde as to do it. Noe the iuſt and good man was an hondreth yeres in preparynge a ſhyppe to ſaue eyght perſo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes. And howe myght I prepare my ſelfe in ſo lytell ſpace to receyue the / whiche haſt made heuen / erth and all creatures. Moyſes thy faythfull ſeruaunt and frende / made a tabernacle of precyous wode couered with golde / for to put in the tables of thy .x. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes / and Ian vnclene creature ſhuld I preſume to receyue the: whiche hath made all lawes &amp; all creatures. Salomon the prudent kynge was .vii. yeres i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> makyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge a precyous temple for to honoure &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhyp the there / &amp; there dyd offre thouſandes

O good lord what great dylygence haue they gyuen in the olde teſtament for to pleaſe the / &amp; howe lytell haue I trauayled and buſyed me to receyue the worthely. There is great dyffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce betwene the tabernacle of Moyſes with the relyques / and thy blyſſed body. Yf they haue ſhowed ſuche deuocyon afore the arche or tabernacle of the teſtament / moche more ſhulde I prepare my ſelfe to receyue the blyſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed body of our lorde Iheſu chryſte in the ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly ſacrament. O father of heuen albeit that I ſhulde be a thouſande yeres in preparyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge my ſelfe / and that I ſhuld haue the holy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of all ſayntꝭ: the charyte of all au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gelles and archau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gelles / the deſyre of all iuſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes / yet neuertheles I knowlege my ſelfe vnworthy to receyue thy onely ſone Iheſu chryſte in the holy ſacrament. O man this thou ſhall vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de after the dygnyte of the holy ſacrament / for there is no perſon ne creature in heuen ſo holy / nor in erth ſo iuſt that myght worthely receyue it. But thou ſhall vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de and knowe for to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forte the / that whan the man dothe prepare hym
<pb facs="tcp:11235:69"/> ſelfe to it by true co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trycyon and confeſſyon that god doth not regarde what he is or hath ben / but onely doth ſe &amp; regarde yf he wold be better tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is / for god doth than forget all his ſynnes / and doth molyfye hym ſelfe by the holy ſacrament. And therfore the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhall proue and ſerche his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcyence in theſe thre poyntes.</p>
               <p>¶ Fyrſte / yf his conſcyence doth moue and prycke hym in any of the deedly ſynnes.</p>
               <p>¶ Secondaryly / yf his wyl be vnyed and ioyned to the wyll of god / ſo that all thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge do pleaſe hym whiche doth pleaſe god / &amp; that all thynge do dyſpleaſe hym / whiche doth dyſpleaſe god.</p>
               <p>¶ Thyrdly / yf the man do fynde in hym ſel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fe that charyte &amp; the loue of god is augmen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted by the holy ſacrament / and that the fere of god is not dymynyſſhed. In theſe poyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes the man ſhall examyne hym ſelfe. And yf he fynde that by oft tymes goynge to the holy ſacrament / the loue of god is not fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent and quycke in hym: and the fere of god is dymynyſſhed / than by humylyte he ſhall refrayne and ſhall not go ſo ofte. For the ly<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fe of one man is the deth of another / but yf he fynde that the loue of god is more ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and quycke in hym by reaſon of the ſame / 
<pb facs="tcp:11235:70"/> and that the fere of god doth encreaſe rather than dymynyſſhe / he ſhall ofte tymes go to the holy ſacrament after the counceyll of a good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſoure and ghoſtly father. For the deſyre of god is / that he maye dwell in the herte of man: and by the ſame habytacyon or preſence of the holy ſacrament / the man doth drawe hym ſelfe from tranſytory thyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges / &amp; doth delyte in heuenly thynges. Alſo by his holy body / ours is renewed / &amp; with it is vnyed and ioyned: ſo that all thynge is oure whiche belongeth vnto hym / ſo that his herte and ours is all one: our body is his our wyttes be his / our power / and all our membres be vnyed with god by the holy ſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>crament. Wherfore he doth ſpeke by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete Dauid. I haue ſpoken: O men ye be godes and all togyther chyldren of heuen / For the ſoule of man is ſo vnyed with god by the holy ſacrament: that all the au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gelles Cherubyns ne Seraphyns can not fynde any dyfference betwene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> two: for where they do moue the ſoule / thyther alſo they do moue god. There was neuer thyng ſo vny<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed as god is with the ſoule of man / for he is nerer and more vnyed / than the ſoule and the body / whiche do man a man. This we may conſydre by many ſayntes and perfyte
<pb facs="tcp:11235:70"/> men whiche haue ſuffred great paynes / pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſſhementes / and tourme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of tyrauntes vnto deth / that theyr bodyes dyde departe from theyr ſoules. Yet theſe tyrauntes could neuer ſeparate god from theyr ſoules with all theyr tourme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tꝭ. This vnyon is greater than yf a droppe of water were put in to a great tonne full of wyne / the which droppe of water ſhall be incontynent conuerted in to wyne. And therfore man yf thou wylte procede from vertue to vertue / from grace to grace / from charyte to charyte / from deſy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re in to deſyre / from the lyght of grace to the lyght of glory / and to come to the perfeccy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of good workes / exercyſe thy ſelfe in the paſſyon of our lorde / and go oft tymes true ten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

For there is nothyng that doth quycken the wyttes ſo moche / nor that doth illumynate the herte with deuocyon / nor that doth lyfte vp the man ſo moche to hygh contemplacy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on / as to receyue the body of our lorde / and reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre his paſſyon. O man yf thou wylt alſo be perfytly pourged from ſynne / enry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in vertues / hyghly illumynate in the holy ſcrypture / boldly vaynquyſſhe thyne enemyes / be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forted in all paynes and try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulacyons / lyue deuoutly in erth / feruently

For the man myght with ſuche and ſo great medytacyon / deſyre / and with ſuche loue and deuocyon receyue the holy ſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>crament that from the loweſt trone of aun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gelles he ſhulde be ſet i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the hygheſt. For god doth not promyſe nor alſo rewarde the man in heuen / after the multytude of his good workes / but alſo after the greatnes of his deſyre &amp; loue. Therfore many do erre which do withdrawe them ſelfe from the holy ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament ſayenge. I worde very oft tymes go to receyue the holy ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t / but I haue no ſpyrytuall rycheſſe in me / that is to ſaye vertues wherwith honeſtly and compete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I maye aorne my ſoule for to receyue the great kynge beynge preſent in the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t The other do ſay / I haue not in me the wa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter of teares for to clenſe and waſſhe my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And ſo they wyll tary vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they be ryche in vertues: and that they ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue abundaunce of teares and feruent deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyon: as they were aſſured therby to receyue god worthely i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the holy ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. O poore man: there be many Turkes / Sarazyns / &amp; Infydelles / whiche haue done many ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous dedes &amp; haue great deuocyon in theyr ſacryfyce / yet neuertheles they do conſyſte &amp; be in dampnacyon of theyr ſoules. It is not that that god doth ſerche. Our lorde Iheſu chryſte doth deſyre and demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de of vs: that we after our poore power prepare our ſelfe by trewe confeſſyon / repentaunce / and con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trycyon and ferme purpoſe neuer to retour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne more to ſyn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e.

               <p>¶ Fyrſte / it ſhulde be great foly &amp; madnes

So do the poore people that do ſytte at the churche dores / ſhowynge to the ryche men theyr nakednes and pouertie: and therby the ryche people be moued with pytie. So alſo ſhall we do: ſhowyng our nakednes of ver<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tues / howe feble ſo euer we be / howe colde and flowe in deuocyon / howe indyſcryte in wordes inclyned to all ſyn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e.

And bycauſe that ſhe dyd not repute her ſelfe worthy to recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue a great grace / god dyd graunt her that / that ſhe dyd demaunde / ye and yf ſhe had deſyred a greater thynge. And this is that / wherof he doth ſpeke by the prophet Dauid The poore ſhall eate &amp; ſhall be fylled / and

               <p>¶ Fyrſte / god is the meate of the poore / in the ſoule.</p>
               <p>¶ Secondaryly / that they ſhall eate vnto they be full. And bycauſe that that is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſyble ſo longe as we be here in erth / vnto y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we come to heuen where we ſhall be fylled Therfore all deuoute perſones ſhall dyſpo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſe themſelfe for to go ofte tymes to the holy ſacrament.
